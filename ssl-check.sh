SSL Certs Are Expiring

Today is ${TODAY}

Your SSL certificate for ${DOMAIN} 
is about to expire.

The expiration date is ${EXPIRATION}

This means you have $(DIFF) days 
remaining before your secure certificate 
will expire leaving your website unprotected.

To stop these messages, renew the SSL certificate for
this domain ${DOMAIN} within the next $(DIFF) days.

Thank you,
